# Kubernetes Training

* Open k8s.html in your browser for the slides
* The `manifests` directory contains example manifests for some of the exercises/examples.
* The `terraform` directory contains terraform manifests to create cluster(s) on
  GKE. (Should mainly be used by the trainer)
* `img/k8s.xml` contains the [Draw.io sources](https://www.draw.io/) for the diagram `img/k8s.svg`
